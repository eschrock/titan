Installation and Configuration
==============================

Installing Docker
-----------------
Before installing Titan, you must have docker configured on your system and
permission to run privileged Linux containers. For MacOS and Windows, this
means installing `Docker Desktop <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>`_.
For Linux, this means `installing docker <https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install>`_
via your distribution-specific mechanism.

If you can run a basic Linux docker container you're ready for the next step::

    docker run --rm busybox:latest echo ready

Downloading Titan
-----------------
To download Titan, head over to the
`Download Page <https://titan-data.io/download>`_ and download the archive
specific to your platform. Extract the archive and place it in a location that
is part of your ``PATH`` such as ``~/bin`` or ``/usr/local/bin``.

If you can get the current Titan version you're ready for the next step::

    $ titan --version
    titan version 0.3.0

Installing Titan
----------------
While Titan is delivered as a standalone executable, it relies on a
containerized service to do a lot of the heavy lifting. The ``titan install``
command will download and run these containers. It may take some time
to download the titan image, but once complete you should be able to see
two containers running named ``titan-docker-launch`` and ``titan-docker-server``::

    $ titan install
    Initializing titan infrastructure ...
    	√ Checking docker installation
    	√ Starting titan server docker containers
    Titan cli successfully installed, happy data versioning :)
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
    ff80dcdf8d0e        titan:latest        "/titan/run"             9 seconds ago       Up 7 seconds        0.0.0.0:5001->5001/tcp   titan-docker-server
    6b09cccc407a        titan:latest        "/bin/bash /titan/la…"   29 seconds ago      Up 14 seconds                                titan-docker-launch

By deafult, this installs a local docker context, and is equivalent to
``titan context install -t docker``. If you want to install Titan
for use with Kubernetes, see the :ref:`lifecycle_context` and
:ref:`lifecycle_kubernetes` sections. If you are operating in a corporate
environment without access to the main docker registry, you can manually load
the ```titandata/titan`` image into a private registry and use the ``-r
registry`` option to ``titan install`` to pull from there instead.

When using the local docker context, the ``titan-<context>-launch`` container is
responsible for installing ZFS on the Docker or host VM. For more information
on how this works and supported configurations, see the :ref:`lifecycle_docker`
section.

If you can successfully run ``titan ls``, then you should be all set::

    $ titan ls
    CONTAINER             STATUS
